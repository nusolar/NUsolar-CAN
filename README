!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!

THIS LIBRARY IS DEPRECATED AND WILL NOT BE UPDATED. PLEASE USE THE "SC7-CAN-ARDUINO" PROJECT WHICH 
IMPLEMENTS THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS A STANDARD ARDUINO LIBRARY (i.e. THERE IS NO LONGER A NEED TO INSTALL THE LIBRARY IN C:/NUsolar/sc7-can)

#################################################

This repository contains a CAN_IO class and a SPI-based library written by DaveAK on the Arduino forums. The library can be used in conjunction with an MCP2515 CAN Controller and an MCP2551 or SN65HVD233 CAN Tranceiver. The CAN_IO class is specific to solar car applications, and implementes all of the CAN packet types used in our SC6 and SC7 solar cars. The DaveAK MCP2515 library is generic, and can be used for all types of CAN communication through the MCP2515.

This repository is organized into subfolders representing the latest working version of the code. Only the latest version is to be edited: all previous versions are locked and should not be modified.

INCLUDING FILES
---------------

In order to use this library in your project, copy the sc7-can-libinclude.cpp and sc7-can-libinclude.h files from the appropriate version folder into your project folder. #inclue the sc7-can-libinclude.h file at the head of any translation unit (code file) in your project which needs to use library functions. 

---------------

!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!
Due to the limited library-handling abilities of the Arduino IDE, this repository must be placed in the following directory in order to be accessable to all other NUsolar libraries:

C:\NUsolar\sc7-can

I.E. the main .git file should be located in

C:\NUsolar\sc7-can\.git

IF THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT PLACED IN THE ABOVE DIRECTORY, NUSOLAR CODE WILL NOT COMPILE.
